# NLP paper implementation with PyTorch (under construction)
The papers were implemented in using korean corpus 

### Classification
+ Using the [Naver sentiment movie corpus v1.0](https://github.com/e9t/nsmc) (a.k.a. `nsmc`)
+ Configuration
  + `conf/model/{type}.json` (e.g. `type = ["sencnn", "charcnn",...]`)
  + `conf/dataset/nsmc.json`
